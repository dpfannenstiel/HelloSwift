Hello Swift
===========

This is a Swift implementation of my basic iOS "Hello, World!" application.  When teaching new developers how to write iOS applications this is the first project they are given. By the end of the project the developer should be able to:

* Utilize Delegation.  Including assigning a delegate to an object, having a class conform to the protocol, and implement one or more delegate methods.

* Respond to keyboard notifications.

The app should:

1. Present a label with an appropriate greeting, "Hello, Swift!", for example.

2. Allow the user to enter an alternate text value.

3. The label should be at the top of the screen.

4. The text field should be at the bottom of the screen.

5. When entering text the text field should be visible to the user.

6. The application should update the label with the new text when the user hit's `Enter` on the keyboard.
